Portfolio for Computational Musicology

**Corpus**
- How has my taste in music changed over the past three years? I will use my bi-monthly playlists from May 2018 until February 2021 as the corpus.
- How average was my taste in music in 2020? I will compare my personal Top Tracks to the NL Top Tracks.
- How average was my taste in music in 2020 versus 2019? I will compare my personal Top Tracks of 2019 to the NL Top Tracks of 2019, and the same for 2020. Then, I will compare these comparisons. My hypothesis is that my taste in music was *less* average in 2020 because I did not listen to any music in social situations (hanging with friends, working out at the gym, partying/clubbing, etc.) due to the Covid situation.
- Which country's Top Tracks of 2020 fits my personal Top Tracks of 2020 best, and why? I will compare my personal Top Tracks to the Top Tracks of several different countries.
